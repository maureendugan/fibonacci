Fibonacci sequence
===============
This is an epicodus assignment

This is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1 (by definition). Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Create a webpage that lets you input a number, and tells you the value of the Fibonacci sequence at that number. For example, if a user inputs 9, they should get back 21.

Solve this problem first with recursion, then without.
